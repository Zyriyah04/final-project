# final-project
I plan on adding the option of adding a choice of choosing a different outfit for the main player, I also want to add some buttons
if possible while being more descriptive of the surroundings of the player. I also want to add on a better storyline for the game
and giving the main player more options and going more in depth with the storyline I will choose.
